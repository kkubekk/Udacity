			<p>Gustaw became our family's member when he was ~ 3 months old. Nobody knows
			where he comes from, who are his parents. At the beginning he seemed to be scared
			unsure of his future. But step by step we made him feel our family memnber.
			It was a real challenge because he is our first dog and we had to "learn" him from the
			scratch. Fortunately all is going well:)</p>
